# google-homepage

This is my second attempt at a google homepage for the odin project.  The code is not perfect, but I am proud of my first project.  I went back and forth between using css grid and flexbox for displaying content and ultimately went with flexbox for the majority of the code.  

There is no functionality on this page.  I just used html and css for this project.
